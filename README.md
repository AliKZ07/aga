### To add a .ps1 file to the path on Windows, you can use the following steps:
1. Open the Start menu and type "environment variables" into the search bar. Click on the "Edit the system environment variables" button.
2. In the System Properties window, click on the "Environment Variables" button.
3. In the Environment Variables window, under the "System variables" section, scroll down and find the "Path" variable, then click on the "Edit" button.
4. In the Edit environment variable window, click on the "New" button and type the path of the directory containing your .ps1 file. For example, if your .ps1 file is in the "C:\Scripts" directory, you would type "C:\Scripts" (without the quotes) into the "New" field.
5. Click on the "OK" button to save the changes and close the window.
6. Open a new command prompt window and type the name of your .ps1 file to run it. You should now be able to run the .ps1 file from any directory on your computer.
